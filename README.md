## 🧾 MCA Scorecard (Rule-Based Consistency Engine)

This repo now includes an **MCA-specific, transparent rule engine** designed to assess whether a business demonstrates the **revenue consistency required to sustainably support a Merchant Cash Advance**.

### Why we added this

The MCA scorecard was introduced following a structured, evidence-led review of our historic MCA lending outcomes.

As part of this process, we built a **training dataset using all previously funded MCA applications**, combining:
- Full transaction-level cashflow data
- Derived financial and behavioural metrics
- **Observed loan outcomes** (paid as agreed, arrears, default)

This analysis highlighted a clear pattern: while traditional financial metrics remain important, **short-term revenue consistency** (frequency, gaps, and stability of inflows) was one of the strongest differentiators between:
- Businesses that repaid smoothly, and  
- Businesses that entered early distress or defaulted.

The existing scorecard is intentionally comprehensive, but MCA underwriting also benefits from a **fast, explainable “cashflow consistency gate”** that:
- Reflects real observed outcomes  
- Can be calibrated independently as more MCA data accumulates  
- Provides immediate, defensible triage decisions  

### How we arrived at this approach

The MCA rule engine is the result of the following process:

1. **Outcome-based training dataset**  
   - We constructed a dataset using only **funded applications**, ensuring all observations had real repayment outcomes.  
   - This anchored decisions in actual performance rather than theoretical assumptions.

2. **Metric review and pattern analysis**  
   - A wide range of transaction-derived metrics were reviewed.  
   - Particular focus was placed on measures of **revenue regularity**, not just total revenue.

3. **Identification of dominant consistency signals**  
   - Three metrics consistently showed strong explanatory power across outcomes:
     - Frequency of inflow days
     - Length of gaps between inflows
     - Volatility of inflow amounts  
   - These signals align closely with the operational reality of MCA products, which rely on frequent trading activity.

4. **Rule-based implementation**  
   - Rather than embedding this logic in a black-box model, it was implemented as a **standalone, rule-based engine**.  
   - This ensures decisions are explainable, auditable, and easy to refine as further outcome data becomes available.

### What it does

The MCA rule engine evaluates three core consistency signals derived from transaction data:

- **Inflow days (last 30 days)** – number of days with positive inflows, indicating trading regularity  
- **Maximum inflow gap (days)** – longest period without inflows, highlighting dependency or trading pauses  
- **Inflow volatility (coefficient of variation)** – stability of inflow amounts; higher values indicate less predictable cashflow  

These are assessed alongside **data sufficiency checks** (e.g. coverage period and activity levels).

The engine returns:

- **Decision**: `APPROVE`, `REFER`, or `DECLINE`  
- **Score (0–100)**: simple points-based ranking for prioritisation  
- **Reasons**: explicit rule triggers for traceability, QA, and governance review  

### How it improves underwriting

- **Evidence-led decisions** grounded in observed repayment behaviour  
- **Faster, consistent triage** of strong vs weak cashflow profiles  
- **Clear audit trail** with explicit decision reasons  
- **Separation of concerns**, keeping MCA consistency policy distinct from broader affordability and risk models  
- **Calibration-friendly design**, with thresholds managed in a single ruleset and reviewed as new outcomes emerge  

### New files

- `mca_scorecard_rules.py` – MCA rule engine containing thresholds, scoring logic, and decision outcomes  
- `score_all_apps.py` – batch runner that applies the MCA rules across all JSON exports and outputs CSV/XLSX for analysis and MI

## 📊 Scoring Methodologies

### 1. 🎯 Subprime Score (Primary)

- **Purpose**: Primary lending decision tool for short-term subprime market
- **Focus**: Debt service coverage (28%), cash balance (18%), and stability (12%)
- **Target Approval Rate**: ~15-25% (tightened thresholds)
- **Risk Factors**: Includes penalties for CCJs, defaults, and operational concerns

### 2. 🏛️ V2 Weighted Score (Secondary)

- **Purpose**: Binary threshold validation system
- **Method**: Pass/fail evaluation against industry benchmarks

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### scikit-learn Version Warning

You may see this warning when running the application:

```
Trying to unpickle estimator StandardScaler from version 1.6.1 when using version 1.7.0
```

**Resolution**: This is a warning, not an error. The ML score is secondary to the subprime score. To fix permanently:

```python
import joblib
model = joblib.load('model. pkl')
scaler = joblib.load('scaler.pkl')
joblib.dump(model, 'model.pkl')
joblib.dump(scaler, 'scaler.pkl')
```

### Modifying Scoring Thresholds

To adjust scoring thresholds, edit both files to maintain consistency:

1. `app/services/subprime_scoring_system.py` - Single application scoring
2. `MCAV2_BatchProcessor/batch_processor_standalone.py` - Batch processing scoring

Key sections to modify:

- `__init__`: Weight allocations and threshold definitions
- `_calculate_base_subprime_score` / `_calculate_tightened_base_score`: Score calculations
- `_determine_risk_tier` / `_determine_tightened_risk_tier`: Tier boundaries
